##Getting started
To develop locally, just clone the repo down to your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/tessajeanserdar/UberRideStats.git
```

Next navigate to the root of the repository and run an npm install.  (if you don't have node yet you'll need to get node.js first, probably through brew).

```
npm install

##How to play

You can play online [here]('http://nameless-journey-16139.herokuapp.com/')

###Rules

Uncover tiles with out uncovering mines! Once you think you've got it , hit the smiley face to see if you've won. The 
closed eye icon can be used to cheat if you get too stuck.
